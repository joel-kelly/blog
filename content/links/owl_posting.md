Delighted to discover this new blog [_Owl Posting_](https://www.owlposting.com/), by Abhishaike Mahajan. 

He writes about incredibly complex topics in Biology and Machine Learning, but in a way I find very accessible given the steep learning curve. It really reminds me of Derek Lowe (of [In the Pipeline](https://www.science.org/blogs/pipeline)) in his way to make a technical topic that I normally wouldn't care about totally fascinating.

The excerpt above is from the really interesting [deep dive on Endometriosis](https://www.owlposting.com/p/endometriosis-is-an-incredibly-interesting).
