excerpt: "‘Wind Knitting Factory’ is a wind powered knitting machine that is attached to the facade of a building. The blades embrace more than a meter in diameter, and the wind that is cached by the mill drives the machine. Like that a long scarf gets knitted along the building downward. When it is windy the machine knits fast and with less wind the machine knits slowly. "
